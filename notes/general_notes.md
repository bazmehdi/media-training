## First Exercise
Create a single-page HTML slideshow application based on the content of this current file. 

Requirements:
1. Parse the content: Use the `---` horizontal rules in the markdown to define the boundaries of each slide.

   - Include a "Next" button fixed at the bottom right to advance slides.
   - Style the slides cleanly using CSS.
3. Tech Stack: Use HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript.
4. Output: Save the code as `intro_AI_Coding.html` inside a new folder named `workarea/slideshow/`.
