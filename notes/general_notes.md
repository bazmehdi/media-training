## First Exercise
Create a single-page HTML slideshow application based on the content of this current file. 

Requirements:
1. Parse the content: Use the `---` horizontal rules in the markdown to define the boundaries of each slide.
2. UI/UX: 
   - Display one slide at a time.
   - Include a "Next" button fixed at the bottom right to advance slides.
   - Style the slides cleanly using CSS.
3. Tech Stack: Use HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript.
4. Output: Save the code as `intro_AI_Coding.html` inside a new folder named `workarea/slideshow/`.

## Instruction Files

[Use custom instructions in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/customization/custom-instructions)

## PRD

A Product Requirements Document (PRD) is an authoritative specification that describes a product or feature’s purpose, scope, user stories, acceptance criteria and measurable success metrics, enabling engineering, design and QA to implement and verify the outcome.

## XAMPP

XAMPP is a free and open-source cross-platform web server solution stack package developed by Apache Friends, consisting mainly of the Apache HTTP Server, MariaDB database, and interpreters for scripts written in the PHP and Perl programming languages. It is a simple, lightweight Apache distribution that makes it extremely easy for developers to create a local web server for testing and deployment purposes.

## Agent Skills

- Agent skills are specialised capabilities that extend what an AI coding assistant can do beyond simple text generation. 

- They enable agents to perform concrete actions such as reading and writing files, running terminal commands, searching codebases, and interacting with external tools or APIs. 

- By equipping agents with these skills, they can operate more autonomously and handle complex, multi-step tasks within a development environment like VS Code. 

- In essence, agent skills bridge the gap between a conversational AI and a practical, hands-on programming assistant that can directly modify and manage your project.
